                    (The figures in the right margin indicate full marks.)
                    Read the passage carefully and answer the question below :-
                    Good manners form an important part of our education. Man's education remains incomplete if he does not learn good manners. In our behaviour with others, we must show proper respect to them. We should have a sense of propriety in our conduct with others. We should show respect to our superiors and civility to our inferiors and equals. A sense of propriety is necessary for a cultured and disciplined society. Again, good manners cost us nothing; they are very often the result of good sense and good nature. There is no fixed standard of manners. Manners vary from one country to another. What is regarded as good manners in our country may not be so in other countries. To shake one by the hand is common in western countries, but it is not so in the East. Similarly, smoking before superiors is frowned upon in our country but it is not so in the West. Manners should be learnt in childhood because childhood is the best time when good manners can be best imbibed. Though good breeding helps men acquire good manners, the influence of parents and superiors is the most decisive in this respect. 
                    The importance of good manners in life is great indeed. Good manners win love and respect for a man and help him in life. Everyone likes a man of good manners and is glad to help him. Really a man of good manners is a gentleman in the true sense of the term.

                    Read the passage carefully and answer the question below :-
                    According to Aristotle, tragedy is an imitation of an action. An action is the process of an individual from one position to another. In other words. an action consists of incidents and events: and the arrangement of these incidents and events is plot. As stated by Aristotle, a plot has a beginning, a middle and an end; and it is so well constructed that no incident can be omitted without destroying the unity of the whole. A plot which consists of a series of disconnected incidents is called episodic plot and it ranks the worst. According to Aristotle, plots are of two kinds simple and complex. A simple plot is one which is single and continuous and in which the change of fortune comes about without a reversal or a discovery. A complex plot, on the other hand, is one in which the change of fortune is accompanied by a discovery or a reversal or both.
